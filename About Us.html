        <h3> About Beach Volleyball</h3>
        Volleyball is a <strong>team sport</strong> played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.<br>
        The sport <strong>originated in the United States</strong>, and is now just achieving the type of popularity
        in the U.S. that it
        has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among participation sports.
        There are <strong>800 million players worldwide </strong>who play Volleyball at <strong>least once a
        week.</strong><br><br>
        The <i>object </i>of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly <b>over</b> the net to ground it
        on the opponent's
        court, and to <b>prevent</b> the ball from being grounded on its own court. The ball is put into play by the
        right
        back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court. A team is allowed to
        hit
        the ball <b>three times</b> (in addition to the block contact) to return it to the opponent's court. A
        player <b>is not
        allowed </b>to hit the ball <i>twice</i> consecutively, <b>except</b> when attempting a block. The <i>rally</i>
        continues
        <b>until the ball
            touches the ground/floor</b>, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a
        fault.

        <br><br>The <b>team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System)</b>. <br>When the <b>receiving team wins
        a rally</b>, it <i>gains
        a
        point</i> and the right to serve, and its <b>players rotate one position clockwise</b>.
        The best of <b>three</b> <i>or</i> best of <b>five</b> games will <b>win matches</b>. Each non-deciding game
        will be <b>won</b> by the team
        that
        <b>first scores 25 points</b> with a <b>minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap)</b>. If there is a deciding
        game, it
        will
        be <b>won by the team that first scores 15 points</b> with a <b>minimum two-point advantage</b> (no scoring
        cap).<br><br>

        <h3>Who Can Play</h3>

        <p>There are <b>800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.</b> <br><br>Volleyball
            is a sport that is
            <b>safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.</b> Since you don’t have to move around the court too
            much, it’s
            <b>great</b> for people who want a <b>low-impact sport</b> that will help them get <b>fit</b> without
            pushing them to their limit.<br><br>
            For those who are a bit more <b>competitive</b>, the sport is <i>fantastic</i> because games can be really
            <b>exciting</b> and
            <b>intense</b>, but there’s <i>always</i> a net between you and your <b>opponents</b>.
            Beach volleyball is suitable for people of <b>all ages</b>, and <i>men</i> and <i>women</i> alike.
            <b>Anyone</b> considering starting a new sport or exercise program should <b>see their doctor first</b>.<br>
